"pclint" is a static source code checker.
It helps detecting programming errors during development.

To run the check you need a license for pclint. The results can either be saved to a text file or be displayed on top of the source code when using Eclipse.
The present configuration is ment for Windows using Mingw as toolchain. To run the check with another toolchain the paths in run-pclint-eclipse.bat need to be change. To run the check under Linux another tool called "flexelint" is required.

Run the check from the top level directory of uncrustify by calling
run-pclint-eclipse.bat

To run the check from Eclipse create a new target and use the script
as build command like that:
${workspace_loc:/uncrustify}/scripts/pclint/run-pclint-eclipse.bat 

The file policy.lnt determines which tests are performed.
The more tests are used the longer it takes but the more 
precise will be the results.
